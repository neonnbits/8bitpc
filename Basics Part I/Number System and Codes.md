**Transistors**: Either the BJT or MOSFET is used. The two state design enables the transistors to work remarkably well in different temperatures.

**Transistor Register**: here's a two state design. the transistor operate in two modes: transistor with 0V is in cut-off mode while transistor with 5V is in saturation mode.

**Nonsaturated Circuits**: Sometimes when BJT is heavily saturated, extra carriers are stored in the base region. The transistor still cannot come out of saturation until these extra carriers have the time to leave the region. The time it takes for these carriers to leave is called saturation time $t_d$.
The BJT has three modes of operation:
- cutoff mode: the transistor is off (no current flows).
- saturation mode: the transistor is fully on (like a switch).
- active mode: the transistor is partially on and can amplify signals.
For high speed systems, we build nonsaturated circuits by avoiding the saturation mode of transistors using clamping diodes.

**Magnetic cores**: they can be used to store binary data almost indefinitely. rectangular hysteresis loops help achieve that. the change in direction of the current through the core reverses the flux which helps us to store 0(counter-clockwise) 1(clockwise).

**Microprocessor**: Five main components of a computer are: input, memory, arithmetic and logic, control and output. The CPU(ALU+control) can now be fabricated onto a single semiconductor chip called the microprocessor.

**Microcomputer:** It has three kinds of chips: microprocessor, memory and I/O chips.

**Powers of 2**

**Hexadecimal Numbers**
It has a base or radix of 16. for the ease of working with the memory locations.

**Memory and Addresses**: If a microcomputer has 32K memory, it means it has 32,768 memory locations, each can store 1 byte.

**Table of Binary Hexadecimal equivalents:**
1111 1111 1111 1111
The first 8 bits are called upper byte(UB) and the second 8 bits are called the lower byte(LB).
Decimal to Hexadecimal conversion can be done with the help of the appendix 2, or hex-dabble or conversion of decimal to binary first and then to hex.

**BCD Numbers**
A **nibble** is a string of 4 bits. Each decimal digit is coded as a nibble.
