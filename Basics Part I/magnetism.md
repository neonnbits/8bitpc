**torque**: rotational analogue of linear force. describes how force causes an object to rotate around it axis.

**euclidean space**: fundamental space of geometry, to represent 3-dimenstional space.

**vector field**: it is the assignment of vector to each point in the euclidean-space. they are used to model the strength and direction of magnetic force.

**magnetic (dipole) moment**: it's a fancy word for torque. vector quantity which represents the amount of torque a magnetic source can experience in an external magnetic field.

**magnetic permeability**: it is the measure of magnetization produced in a material in response to an external magnetic field.

**magnetic field (B)**: a vector field that describes the influence of magnetic forces in space. $1 \text{ T} = 10^4\text{ G}$.

**magnetic field strength (H)**: it represents the external magnetic field applied to a material. measured in ampere-turns per meter (A/m).

**magnetic flux density (B)**: it is the magnetic field inside a material in response to H. $$\text{B} = \mu H$$ where $\mu$ is the permeability of the material.

**ferromagnetic material**: it can retain magnetization even after the external magnetic field(H) is removed.

**magnetic hysteresis**: the **hysteresis loop** describes the relationship between B (or M) and H for a ferromagnetic material as H is cycled.
