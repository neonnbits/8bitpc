**semiconductor** - it is a material (like silicon or germanium) that has electrical conductivity between a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like rubber). Its conductivity can be modified by a process called **doping**.

**intrinsic semiconductor** is a **undoped** semiconductor, which means the impurities are not yet present or introduced.

**extrinsic semiconductor** is a doped semiconductor.

**doping**: In semiconductor production, **doping** is the introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties. the doping process introduces the charge carriers(electrons, ions, holes) which increase conductivity. there are two types of doping agents which results in two different types of extrinsic semiconductors. 
- an **electron donor**(phosphorus, arsenic) dopant will release electrons into the crystal lattice which will become the majority charge carriers and hence called **n-type semiconductor**.
- an **electron acceptor**(boron, gallium) dopant will accept electrons from the lattice creating holes in the lattice which will act as the charge carriers and are in majority, hence called **p-type semiconductor**.

**valence band**: The **valence band** is the **energy band** that holds the **electrons** that are involved in chemical bonding between atoms. In a semiconductor, the **valence band** is **full** at low temperatures.
**conduction band**: the conduction band is the **energy band** where electrons are free to move, allowing them to **conduct electric current**. semiconductors have empty conduction band at absolute zero temperature.

**p-n junction**: when we combine the p-type semiconductor and n-type semiconductor a junction is formed called the depletion layer where there are positive ions on the n-side and negative ions on the p-side. these ions create an electric field opposing further diffusion of charge carriers. this electric field maintain the width of the depletion layer.

**forward bias:** in this mode the p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the n-side to negative terminal. with increase in bias the depletion region gets smaller due to charge carriers being able to move freely through the junction as the in-built electric field strength gets reduced thereby neutralizing the immobile ions in the region. when the applied voltage reaches the forward threshold voltage the electrons from n-side move to the positive terminal of the battery and the holes in the opposite direction thereby allowing current flow.

**reverse bias**: in this mode the p-side is connected to the negative terminal of the battery and the n-side to positive. the positive terminal attracts the electrons in the n-side and the negative side attracts holes from the p-side thereby widening the depletion region and increasing the resistance. only the minority charge carriers on either sides contribute to the current flow which is extremely small. the small current is called the reverse saturation current ($I_s$). breakdown occurs when the applied voltage crosses the breakdown voltage value.(zener breakdown, avalanche breakdown)

**diode**: it is a two terminal electrical component which conducts electricity in one direction and offers extremely high resistance in the opposite direction. semiconductor diodes are the most commonly used type with the p-n junction connected between two electrical terminals. used in rectifiers to convert ac to dc.

**transistor**(most important): it is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals or power. it usually has three terminals for connection with an electronic circuit.
